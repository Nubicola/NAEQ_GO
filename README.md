# NAEQ_GO

This command-line utility will read inputs and output eq values. The purpose is to quickly build NAEQ_##.md files for use in the other project, naeq_obsidian. 

In particular,
-f=file to read a file
-d=dir  to read all files in a directory
(list on the command line) to process the words on the command line.

-o=dir to write NAEQ_##.md files

The latter isn't working yet. Instead everything is written to stdout.
